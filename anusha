Republic Day is a national holiday in India commemorating the adoption of the Constitution of India, and the country's transition to a republic which came into effect on 26 January 1950.

The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the governing document of India, thus turning the nation from a dominion into a republic post its independence from the British Raj in 1947. The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950. The date was chosen as the Indian National Congress proclaimed Purna Swaraj (complete independence) on this day in 1930.
